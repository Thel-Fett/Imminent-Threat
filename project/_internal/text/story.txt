As you begin to fly your ship towards the station for your system check up,
the lights flicker as the ship jolts to a stop. As you regain your balance,
and composure, you make your way to the main control panel. Luckily, the backup
system for the panel was not effected like the rest of the ship. Now under the fent glow
of red emergency lights, you bring the control panel to life, and a light blue screen starts up.
