Upon entering the room you consider what options you have before you.
You can visit other rooms, those being the airlock, bedroom, kitchen,
living area, and cargo bay or you could ask your AI for some advise
as well as look at the systems administrative panels for some extra infomartion.
You can still hear noises from the vents, though they're distant, you must make a decision fast.
