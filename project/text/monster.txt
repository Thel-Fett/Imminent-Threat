You see the monster in front of you, its towering form casting a menacing shadow on the ground.
You see it's covered in dark black fur, as black space. It has long, gnarled arms that end in monstrous
claws, capable of tearing through anything in its path. You look down it's legs and see that they end
with large clawed feet, very similar to the the hands, but the claws seem to be for traversing rough
areas. You see that it heard you come in, even over all the alarms, as it turns to face you. The creature's
mouth has huge sharp teeth, and it's face is battle scared and missing an eye, and it has, what looks like
28 stab wounds spread across it's chest. It's injured and it looks hostile, however you think you might able
to get closer to the creature and fix it up without getting injured, or you could just shoot and kill it.
