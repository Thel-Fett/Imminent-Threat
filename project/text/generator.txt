You power on the generator and you hear it whirring to life sending power to the ship.
After starting the generator, you hear the ship slowly creak and whine back to life as all the systems
come back online. A couple minutes pass by and you hear the ships intercom say "Cargo bay now unlocked"
and "Living area now unlocked". You decide to go to the cargo bay first to see what's waiting for you there.
