[SYSTEM] Airlock opening.
As the airlock opens, you see the red glow of emergency lights enter the bridge of your ship.
Directly ahead is the cargo bay, where you remember having some cargo from a mission,
it's contents were not disclosed to you, so that could be a lead. To left of you is the kitchen,
and to the right is the bedroom, both of which you have unlocked.
